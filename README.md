# Cybersecurity Journey
This repository documents my long-term, self-directed journey in cybersecurity.
It represents a structured and evolving learning process focused on building
strong theoretical foundations, technical understanding, and practical awareness
of security concepts over time.
## Background
I am a Computer Science student, and cybersecurity is not part of my formal
academic curriculum. Recognizing the growing importance of this field, I chose
to independently pursue a disciplined and structured self-learning path to
develop a solid and well-grounded understanding of cybersecurity.
## Scope of Learning
This repository progressively covers:
- Core cybersecurity principles and threat models
- Operating system fundamentals with an emphasis on Linux
- Networking concepts essential to system and network security
- Gradual exploration of defensive security and monitoring concepts
## Learning Approach
The content presented here emphasizes understanding over memorization. Each
topic is approached with the goal of developing analytical thinking, security
awareness, and the ability to connect theoretical concepts to real-world
security scenarios.
## Purpose
This repository serves as a personal learning log and knowledge base, designed
to reflect consistency, intellectual growth, and continuous improvement over
time. It prioritizes clarity, organization, and long-term progression rather
than short-term results.
