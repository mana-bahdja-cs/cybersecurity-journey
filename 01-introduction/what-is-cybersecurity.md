# Understanding Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is a multidisciplinary field dedicated to protecting digital
systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, misuse, disruption, and
destruction. It combines technical, analytical, and strategic practices to
ensure that information systems remain secure and trustworthy.
In an increasingly digital world, cybersecurity is no longer optional. It has
become a fundamental requirement for individuals, organizations, and
governments that rely on technology to operate and communicate.

## The Purpose of Cybersecurity
The primary purpose of cybersecurity is to protect information and systems
against threats that can compromise their reliability and safety. These threats
may originate from malicious actors, system vulnerabilities, or human error.
Cybersecurity aims to create resilient systems that can prevent attacks, detect
abnormal behavior, and recover effectively from incidents.

## The CIA Triad: Core Security Principles
At the foundation of cybersecurity lie three essential principles, commonly
known as the CIA Triad:
- Confidentiality  
  Ensuring that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized entities.
- Integrity  
  Maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data throughout its lifecycle.
- Availability  
  Guaranteeing that systems and information remain accessible to legitimate users
  when required.
These principles guide the design, implementation, and evaluation of secure
systems.

## Cybersecurity as a Defensive Discipline
While cybersecurity includes both offensive and defensive approaches, its core
mission is defensive in nature. Defensive security focuses on monitoring,
detecting, and responding to potential threats in order to minimize risk and
impact.
This defensive perspective emphasizes understanding how attacks occur, not to
replicate them, but to better prevent and mitigate them.

## Scope of the Field
Cybersecurity encompasses multiple interconnected domains, including:
- Network and infrastructure security
- Operating system and endpoint security
- Application and software security
- Security monitoring and incident response
Together, these domains form a comprehensive framework for protecting modern
digital environments.

## Reflection
Cybersecurity is not solely a technical field; it also requires critical
thinking, continuous learning, and ethical responsibility. Developing a strong
foundation in cybersecurity involves understanding both the technology being
protected and the nature of the threats it faces.
